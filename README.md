# LES-emulator-01prepros
preprosessing of emulator

This repository holds scripts that are used to initialise LES runs.
The most vital of these is [emulator_inputs.py](emulator_inputs.py)
which creates sounding files and namelists for UCLALES-SALSA [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5289397](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5289397).
